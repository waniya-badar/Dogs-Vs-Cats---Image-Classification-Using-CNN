# Dogs-Vs-Cats---Image-Classification-Using-CNN
Dogs Vs Cats - A deep learning project that classifies images of dogs and cats using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras. Trained on the Kaggle Dogs vs Cats dataset with batch loading, image preprocessing, and real-time inference.

### Features:
- Built a 3-layer CNN with Batch Normalization and Dropout for regularization.

- Achieved ~90% validation accuracy using optimized architecture.

- Efficient memory usage with image_dataset_from_directory and data batching.

- Normalized image inputs for faster convergence.

- Visualized training progress using Matplotlib.

 
### Tech Stack:
- Python

- TensorFlow & Keras

- NumPy, Matplotlib

- Kaggle Datasets
